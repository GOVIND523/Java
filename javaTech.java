$ Java Technology

          # Java is both a programming language and a platform.

          # Java is a programming language that is simple , object oriented ,
             distributed , multithreaded , Dynamic , Architecture independent ,
             portable , high performance , robust , secure.

          # In Java programming language, all source code is first written in
             a plain text file with .java extension. Compiled into .class file
             by javac compiler. .class file contains the bytecode ( Machine 
             language of the JVM ). The java launcher tool then runs your 
             application with an instance of Java Virtual Machine.

          # The Java Platform - A platform is the hardware or software environment
             in which a program runs. Java Platform has two components 
             [i]  The Java Virtual Machine ( JVM )
             [ii] The Java Application Interface ( API )

          # The API is a large collection of raedy-made software components that
             provide many useful capibilities. It is grouped into libraries of 
             related classes and interfaces, these libraries are known as packages.

$ Java capabilities

          # Development tools that provide compilation , running , monitoring , 
             debugging and documentation. jhavadoc is the documentation tool.
          
          # Application Programming Interface provides core functionality offering wide 
             array of classes.

          # Deployment Technologies comes with JDK to provide Java Web Software and 
             Java Plug-In software for deploying application to end users.

          # User Interface Toolkits like JavaFX , Swing and Java 2D for craeting 
             GUI's.
          
          # Integration libraries enables data access and manipulation of remote
             objects.

$ Features of Java
          # Easy to learn
          # Write better code
          # Write less code than C++
          # Develop programs more quickly
          # Avoid platform dependencies
          # Write once , run anywhere
          # Distribute software more easily
